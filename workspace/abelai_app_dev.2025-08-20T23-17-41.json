    "text": "Trump declares China can purchase Iranian oil as market signals cautious optimism President Donald Trump cleared China to purchase Iranian oil on Tuesday, eliminating longstanding sanctions limiting the trade relationship. Trump announced the move in a social media post while flying to Europe on Air Force One, adding that he hopes China will also purchase \"plenty\" of oil from the U.S. \"China can now continue to purchase Oil from Iran. Hopefully, they will be purchasing plenty from the U.S., also. It was my Great Honor to make this happen!\" Trump wrote. Oil prices continued to drop and markets surged Tuesday as Trump battered Iran and Israel into accepting a precarious ceasefire agreement. The agreement has curbed concerns that Iran would shut down the Strait of Hormuz, a key trade route for shipping oil across the globe. EXXONMOBIL CEO TALKS OIL SUPPLY AMID IRAN-ISRAEL CONFLICT Crude hit $65 per barrel in extended trading after West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell more than 8% to about $67 per barrel on Monday afternoon. Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell to $70 a barrel. Washington reinstated sanctions on Tehran in 2018, and Trump's administration has imposed several new rounds of sanctions on Iran's oil trade since taking office in January. Trump's sanctions had included penalties on three Chinese oil import companies, which led to curtailed buying. Last week, industry experts warned that Iran shutting down the Strait of Hormuz could cause prices to surge to as much as $120 a barrel. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS Roughly 20% of the world's oil supply travels through the strait, though closing it would significantly hurt Iran's own revenue. Energy Secretary Chris Wright dismissed concerns about its closing on Tuesday, telling Fox News that the move would harm Iran more than it would anyone else. \"The United States today is a net oil exporter. We don't count in any meaningful way on oil coming out of that strait. Iran would harm itself more than it would harm anyone else. It'll probably cause a mess or trouble, but it'll be small,\" Wright said. Reuters contributed to this report.",

    "text": "These Questions Separate the Rich from the Poor According to Dave Ramsey Debt has long been part of the American lifestyle. Many of us succumb to loans and credit cards when faced with financial predicaments, and these balances can be carried for months or years, continuing to grow under high interest rates. Dave Ramsey is one of the top financial gurus, and he has made a name for himself specifically regarding his hardcore advice regarding debt. Ramsey says a key method of avoiding debt is to stop asking “how much down?” and start asking “How much?” He reminds us of the value of living within our means. Ramsey’s focus on helping Americans get out of debt is based on real world concerns; Data from Debt.com reveals one in three Americans have maxed out their credit cards. Another shocking statistic from Business Insider states that the average American has upwards of $104,000 in debt. And as citizens continue to struggle with economic issues, credit card use only continues to rise. This burdensome cycle can begin to feel relentless. This slideshow reveals Ramsey’s best financial advice regarding debt, including the latest statistics, how to find your way out of debt, and tips to avoid future debt. If you want to regain control of your finances and make a firm commitment to your future, check out Dave Ramsey’s proven methods. Dave Ramsey&#8217;s Debt Philosophy Dave Ramsey highlights the importance of mindset in financial decisions. He believes rich people ask, &#8216;How much?&#8217; while poor people ask, &#8216;How much down?&#8217; This reflects a focus on affordability versus long-term debt. The Weight of American Debt Business Insider reports the average American holds $104,215 in debt. This includes mortgages, student loans, auto loans, and credit card debt. Debt can quickly become overwhelming, especially with rising interest rates. The Credit Card Trap 1 in 3 Americans have maxed out their credit cards according to Debt.com. Many people rely on credit to afford basic needs due to inflation. 22% carry $10,000–$20,000 in debt, and 5% owe more than $30,000. Massive Growth of the Debt Industry Visa and MasterCard stocks are near record highs. Credit card balances exceeded $1 trillion in Q4 2023. The debt industry is booming despite rising financial insecurity for many. Psychology of Spending Ramsey stresses that poor spending decisions often stem from emotional buying. Social media and constant advertising pressure consumers to spend. Asking &#8216;Can I afford this?&#8217; is a better question than &#8216;Can I make the down payment?&#8217; How Inflation Drives Debt Inflation has caused basic expenses to rise significantly. 45% of people report using credit cards to pay for necessities. This reliance contributes to long-term debt and high interest payments. Ramsey&#8217;s Core Advice Ramsey’s core philosophy is: &#8216;Don’t buy it if you can’t afford it.&#8217; This means avoiding purchases that lead to debt without secure income. He promotes living below your means as a path to wealth. Budgeting to Break Free Weekly budgeting helps differentiate between wants and needs. Small, consistent savings add up over time. Budgeting allows for better financial planning and less reliance on credit. Cutting Credit Card Dependency Avoid habitual use of credit cards by using cash or debit. Credit card interest makes small purchases cost significantly more. Track spending regularly to stay within budget. Consider Debt Consolidation Refinancing high-interest credit cards can reduce debt faster. Consolidation into lower-interest loans may provide relief.

The Weight of American Debt Business Insider reports the average American holds $104,215 in debt. This includes mortgages, student loans, auto loans, and credit card debt. Debt can quickly become overwhelming, especially with rising interest rates. The Credit Card Trap 1 in 3 Americans have maxed out their credit cards according to Debt.com. Many people rely on credit to afford basic needs due to inflation. 22% carry $10,000–$20,000 in debt, and 5% owe more than $30,000. Massive Growth of the Debt Industry Visa and MasterCard stocks are near record highs. Credit card balances exceeded $1 trillion in Q4 2023. The debt industry is booming despite rising financial insecurity for many. Psychology of Spending Ramsey stresses that poor spending decisions often stem from emotional buying. Social media and constant advertising pressure consumers to spend. Asking &#8216;Can I afford this?&#8217; is a better question than &#8216;Can I make the down payment?&#8217; How Inflation Drives Debt Inflation has caused basic expenses to rise significantly. 45% of people report using credit cards to pay for necessities. This reliance contributes to long-term debt and high interest payments. Ramsey&#8217;s Core Advice Ramsey’s core philosophy is: &#8216;Don’t buy it if you can’t afford it.&#8217; This means avoiding purchases that lead to debt without secure income.

    "text": "Vinanz puts its money to work with $3.85m bitcoin buy Vinanz Ltd (LSE:BTC, OTCQB:VINZF) has added nearly 37.72 bitcoin to its corporate treasury, bringing its total holdings to 58.68, as the London-listed company continues to build a bitcoin-focused investment strategy. The latest purchases were made at an average price of $102,056 per coin, totalling $3.85 million and quickly deploying a substantial chunk of the $4.9 million (£3.6 million) raised in its oversubscribed WRAP retail offer. It marks the first transaction conducted through its new institutional custody account with Fidelity Digital Assets, a move that signals an increasing focus on secure, large-scale holdings. CEO Hewie Rattray said: \"We are continuing to execute on our vision of building the most transparent, publicly traded bitcoin treasury company in the UK. \"With this latest purchase, and our onboarding with Fidelity Digital Assets, we are reinforcing both our conviction in bitcoin and our commitment to institutional-grade custody, governance, and access for investors seeking listed exposure to BTC. \"We look forward to updating the market later this week as we deploy additional capital from the direct subscription tranche of the fundraise into Bitcoin assets.\" Vinanz, which trades on the London Stock Exchange and in the United States, also operates bitcoin mining sites across North America. The company said the average cost of its entire bitcoin portfolio now stands at $97,491. The approach mirrors a broader trend among publicly listed groups seeking to use digital assets as an alternative store of value, though price volatility remains a central risk. Bitcoin prices have risen sharply in recent months, fuelled by institutional demand and the launch of new investment vehicles in major markets The price of gold dropped 1.2% to a two-week lows below $3,320 after Israel and Iran agreed a ceasefire, following 12 days of fighting. Gold has fallen around 2% over the past week, after gaining from safe haven demand in the past week amid an escalation of hostilities and missile strikes, culminating with US intervention in the form of 'bunker buster' bombs dropped on Iran's nuclear facilities over the weekend. US President Donald Trump revealed in a post at just after 11pm London time that \"it has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a complete and total ceasefire\" and that once final military activities had been completed in the subsequent few hours \"the war will be considered ended\". Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the truce, with Iran’s foreign minister saying that \"we have no intention to continue our response\" provided that Israel stops its aggression and that a final decision on cessation of military operations \"will be made later\". The news also sent oil prices tumbling and a retreat for the US dollar. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, says: \"The pronouncement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran and the lack of meaningful response from the latter to the US strikes over the weekend have lifted investor spirits and removed a plank of uncertainty. \"The news gives fresh impetus to a risk-on approach, which has lifted shares across most developed markets, while also weighing on the gold price as investors switched their attention elsewhere.\"",

The latest purchases were made at an average price of $102,056 per coin, totalling $3.85 million and quickly deploying a substantial chunk of the $4.9 million (£3.6 million) raised in its oversubscribed WRAP retail offer. It marks the first transaction conducted through its new institutional custody account with Fidelity Digital Assets, a move that signals an increasing focus on secure, large-scale holdings. CEO Hewie Rattray said: \"We are continuing to execute on our vision of building the most transparent, publicly traded bitcoin treasury company in the UK. \"With this latest purchase, and our onboarding with Fidelity Digital Assets, we are reinforcing both our conviction in bitcoin and our commitment to institutional-grade custody, governance, and access for investors seeking listed exposure to BTC. \"We look forward to updating the market later this week as we deploy additional capital from the direct subscription tranche of the fundraise into Bitcoin assets.\" Vinanz, which trades on the London Stock Exchange and in the United States, also operates bitcoin mining sites across North America.

    "text": "Polarean inks US sales deal to boost lung imaging product reach Polarean Imaging PLC (AIM:POLX, OTC:PLLWF) has signed a commercial agreement with Ascend Imaging, a US-based medical technology distributor, as part of efforts to expand sales of its lung imaging products in the United States. The UK-listed company, which develops specialist magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology using hyperpolarised xenon gas, said Ascend would act as an independent sales representative in four US states. The agreement is non-exclusive, meaning Polarean is free to enter into similar arrangements elsewhere. Ascend, which focuses on imaging and radiology solutions, will help identify new customers, support contract negotiations and promote Polarean's products, including its xenon-based MRI platform. The deal is intended to strengthen the company’s reach in key US markets without significantly increasing its internal salesforce. \"This partnership enhances our reach in key US regions while maintaining operational efficiency, and we expect it to support meaningful commercial momentum in the second half of 2025 and beyond,\" Alan Huang, Polarean's vice president of sales. The company's imaging technology is designed to provide clearer and more detailed pictures of lung function than conventional scans. It is primarily aimed at diagnosing and monitoring respiratory conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, by allowing clinicians to see how air moves through the lungs in real time. The price of gold dropped 1.2% to a two-week lows below $3,320 after Israel and Iran agreed a ceasefire, following 12 days of fighting. Gold has fallen around 2% over the past week, after gaining from safe haven demand in the past week amid an escalation of hostilities and missile strikes, culminating with US intervention in the form of 'bunker buster' bombs dropped on Iran's nuclear facilities over the weekend. US President Donald Trump revealed in a post at just after 11pm London time that \"it has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a complete and total ceasefire\" and that once final military activities had been completed in the subsequent few hours \"the war will be considered ended\". Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the truce, with Iran’s foreign minister saying that \"we have no intention to continue our response\" provided that Israel stops its aggression and that a final decision on cessation of military operations \"will be made later\". The news also sent oil prices tumbling and a retreat for the US dollar. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, says: \"The pronouncement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran and the lack of meaningful response from the latter to the US strikes over the weekend have lifted investor spirits and removed a plank of uncertainty. \"The news gives fresh impetus to a risk-on approach, which has lifted shares across most developed markets, while also weighing on the gold price as investors switched their attention elsewhere.\"",

    "text": "Polarean inks US sales deal to boost lung imaging product reach Polarean Imaging PLC (AIM:POLX, OTC:PLLWF) has signed a commercial agreement with Ascend Imaging, a US-based medical technology distributor, as part of efforts to expand sales of its lung imaging products in the United States. The UK-listed company, which develops specialist magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology using hyperpolarised xenon gas, said Ascend would act as an independent sales representative in four US states. The agreement is non-exclusive, meaning Polarean is free to enter into similar arrangements elsewhere. Ascend, which focuses on imaging and radiology solutions, will help identify new customers, support contract negotiations and promote Polarean's products, including its xenon-based MRI platform. The deal is intended to strengthen the company’s reach in key US markets without significantly increasing its internal salesforce. \"This partnership enhances our reach in key US regions while maintaining operational efficiency, and we expect it to support meaningful commercial momentum in the second half of 2025 and beyond,\" Alan Huang, Polarean's vice president of sales. The company's imaging technology is designed to provide clearer and more detailed pictures of lung function than conventional scans. It is primarily aimed at diagnosing and monitoring respiratory conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, by allowing clinicians to see how air moves through the lungs in real time. The price of gold dropped 1.2% to a two-week lows below $3,320 after Israel and Iran agreed a ceasefire, following 12 days of fighting. Gold has fallen around 2% over the past week, after gaining from safe haven demand in the past week amid an escalation of hostilities and missile strikes, culminating with US intervention in the form of 'bunker buster' bombs dropped on Iran's nuclear facilities over the weekend. US President Donald Trump revealed in a post at just after 11pm London time that \"it has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a complete and total ceasefire\" and that once final military activities had been completed in the subsequent few hours \"the war will be considered ended\". Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the truce, with Iran’s foreign minister saying that \"we have no intention to continue our response\" provided that Israel stops its aggression and that a final decision on cessation of military operations \"will be made later\". The news also sent oil prices tumbling and a retreat for the US dollar. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, says: \"The pronouncement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran and the lack of meaningful response from the latter to the US strikes over the weekend have lifted investor spirits and removed a plank of uncertainty. \"The news gives fresh impetus to a risk-on approach, which has lifted shares across most developed markets, while also weighing on the gold price as investors switched their attention elsewhere.\"",

    "text": "A 'Public Health Emergency': Since January, New Haven County Has Seen 68 Fatal Opioid ODs NEW HAVEN, CT - Since the beginning of the year, there have been 68 fatal overdoses in New Haven County. In all of 2024, 72 New Haveners died from drug overdoses, the overwhelming majority from opioids, state health data shows. To call it a crisis is not hyperbole. Just ask the New Haven-based APT Foundation. \"This is a public health emergency,\" APT Foundation President and CEO Dr. Lynn Madden said, \"That we already have the tools to fix.\" In response to the “urgent overdose and opioid crisis,” APT just launched its Let’s Break Barriers to Treatment, Medication for Opioid Use Disorder Works campaign. Kicked off last week, APT’s \"bold\" public awareness campaign advocates for “immediate access to life-saving care for individuals struggling with opioid use disorder.\" It’s using billboards spread across New Haven County, digital ads, and an animated video on its website and social channels, \"urging swift action to eliminate treatment delays.\" \"Every day, someone in Connecticut dies waiting for treatment that could have started today,\" Madden said. \"This campaign is about sending a clear message: no more waiting, no more barriers.\" The APT Foundation’s mission is to promote health and recovery for individuals living with substance use disorders and/or mental illness by providing “low-barrier, evidence-based treatment.” APT serves more than 8,000 people a year at its five New Haven clinical sites, including at 1 Long Wharf. According to a joint study by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control released in 2023, over 107,000 Americans died from drug overdoses. More than 70 percent of those deaths involved opioids. But less than one in five people with opioid use disorder get the medication they need. More than two million Americans are currently living with OUD, and opioid-related deaths are outpacing traffic and firearm fatalities. APT describes itself as a \"leader in the Open Access Model,\" reducing treatment wait times from weeks to hours. APT partners with the Connecticut Department of Corrections to reach justice-involved populations. It also engages in cutting-edge research supported by the NIH and regularly hosts community forums and overdose prevention training to raise awareness and expand access to care. The Let’s Break Barriers to Treatment campaign reframes OUD care as urgent medical care, not only a long-term rehabilitation issue. The campaign calls on healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the public to recognize that timely access to medication for opioid use disorder—like methadone and buprenorphine—can prevent deaths, support recovery, and reduce harm immediately. The campaign’s priorities include: The APT Foundation has operated one of the state’s \"most accessible\" opioid use disorder medication programs for more than 50 years. The clinic locations open as early as 5 a.m., accept walk-ins, and offer same-day access to treatment without lengthy intake processes. \"I knew I’d get help that day—that’s why I came here, and why I stayed,” a patient shared. “No judgment. Just treatment.\" But despite APT’s success, \"systemic delays, regulatory hurdles, and cultural stigma still keep many from timely care, with tragic consequences,\" according to the Foundation. \"We don’t delay treatment for strokes or heart conditions,\" Madden said. \"Opioid use disorder is just as urgent. We need to treat it that way.\"",

Both these companies have survived market volatility and have the potential to increase dividends. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Indian stock market indices saw a downturn in the early trading hours on Monday, with Nifty50 and Sensex falling sharply. Nifty50 dropped below the 25,000 mark, due to growing tensions in the Middle East and the implications of U.S. military actions. Analysts believe that market performance will continue to be influenced by global developments and that market volatility could be seen due to geopolitical tensions. Amid the ongoing volatility, investors need to look for stocks that have seen it all and yet thrived. These are companies that believe in rewarding shareholders and stand strong despite the market&#8217;s ups and downs. If you&#8217;re a passive income investor, here are 2 Nifty50 dividend giants to buy today. Hindustan Zinc Dividend yield: 6.6% Hindustan Zinc is engaged in the business of exploring, extracting, and processing minerals. It has several mines and plants in addition to four capital solar plants in Rajasthan. Trading for Rs. 443, the stock has remained flat in 2025 and is down 32.74% in 12 months. Overall, it is up over 100% in five years. It enjoys a strong dividend yield of 6.6%. India’s zinc demand is expected to double over the next five to ten years and the company is taking the necessary steps to double the production capacity. Hindustan Zinc has a strong future ahead and the board has approved a growth capex of Rs.12,000 crore which is aimed at increasing the refining metal capacity by 250 KTPA (kilotonnes per annum). This project is expected to be completed in three years. In the recent quarter, the company reported a net consolidated profit of Rs. 3,003 crore, up 47.3% year over year and the income stood at Rs 9,314 crore, up 20.37% year-over-year. The company announced an interim dividend of Rs. 7 per share. The rising silver prices have also benefited Hindustan Zinc. Analysts at JM Financial have a buy rating for the stock with a price target of Rs. 550. Motilal Oswal has a price target of Rs.480. Hindustan Zinc is a stable, fundamentally strong company with an attractive dividend yield. It has the ability to sustain dividends and increase them in the long term. Tata Steel Dividend yield: 2.37% Exchanging hands for Rs.152, Tata Steel stock is down 14% in 12 months but the stock has regained the lost value over the past six months and is up 11% in 2025. Overall, the stock has soared over 300% in five years. Tata Steel is a steel manufacturing company in India. In the recent quarterly results, Tata Steel saw an impressive 117% year-over-year jump in net profit to Rs. 1,201 crore. The company saw an improvement in the volume, but its revenue dropped due to the low steel prices in the fourth quarter. It announced a dividend of Rs.3.6 per share. The management is set to invest $2.5 billion in its Singapore unit during FY26 to support its European business and for debt repayment. Its consolidated revenue came in at Rs. 56,218 crore, down 4% year over year and its Indian operations saw a 19% drop in net profit due to the lower steel prices. However, the long-term picture looks positive for Tata Steel. The demand for steel is always going to be there but once the price picks up, we could see Tata Steel report impressive numbers again. Despite the dip in profits in its India operations, the quarterly sales were the best-ever in the country at 21 million tonnes. Any dip in the stock is a chance to buy and analysts recommend holding the stock for the next two years. The post 2 Nifty50 Dividend Giants to Buy Today appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

Mihran Panosyan, 46, of Winnetka, took part in a plan with others to run a series of sham hospice companies, impersonating Russian and Ukrainian nationals and using those identities to open bank accounts and sign leases as the purported hospice owners, and submitting false claims to Medicare for services that weren’t medically necessary or provided, authorities said. Panosyan — also known as Mike Hope — pleaded guilty in federal court in Los Angeles to a charge of money laundering as part of a plea agreement. He was ordered to pay over $4 million in restitution and forfeit money and property, including a 2019 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT63 S, according to court documents obtained by Patch. He's set to be sentenced on Sept. 8. He faces up to 20 years in prison, according to prosecutors. Panosyan's co-defendant, Petros Fichidzhyan, pleaded guilty in February to charges of health care fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering, and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. The other three defendants in the case are set to stand trial beginning July 29. The five codefendants including a married couple and several cousins, according to court documents. Their scheme had three parts: Three of the co-defendants used the identities of foreign nationals no longer living in the U.S. to operate several sham hospice companies.

Then, the codefendants laundered the proceeds: Panosyan transferred proceeds of the Medicare fraud between accounts in the names of the purported foreign owners, the sham hospices, and other shell corporations, laundering more than $4.6 million in fraudulently obtained funds that he used to purchase real estate, pay for private school for his child and more, according to prosecutors.",

    "title": "I Just Inherited $500,000 – How Can I Build a Self-Directed Dividend Portfolio?",
    "text": "I Just Inherited $500,000 – How Can I Build a Self-Directed Dividend Portfolio? There is perhaps no better way to put a $500,000 windfall to work than to stash it in a self-directed investment portfolio. Indeed, you don&#8217;t need to be a wizard at stock-picking to do well and grow your wealth over the years. All it takes is patience and a solid game plan to transform an inheritance into a retirement portfolio that generates a good amount of passive income for life. Undoubtedly, going down the dividend route (which sees investors pursue higher yields) isn&#8217;t all too bad an idea. But for someone who&#8217;s new to investing, it can be pretty easy to be carried away as one chases yield across various corners of the stock market. With half a million to invest, it&#8217;s probably best not to veer too far off course by loading up on the yields well above 7-8% without a rock-solid foundation to build upon (think a diversified dividend-focused ETF). Key Points Investing one’s $500k windfall is a smart idea, regardless of the market’s mood at any given time. For a dividend investor, starting with a higher-yield ETF like the SCHD and SPYD is a great way to start. Afterward, individual names can be added to the mix. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Dividend investing is smart, but don&#8217;t forget about appreciation. Though covered call ETFs can provide safer, beefier yields, it&#8217;s their &#8220;total returns&#8221; that income investors should keep track of. In a prior piece, I highlighted the dangers of chasing yield and not keeping tabs on capital appreciation and total returns. At the end of the day, a young person needs not only a decent dividend yield but a good amount of growth to pick up the pace on the road to a comfortable retirement. For instance, it&#8217;s far better to have a 4% yield alongside a 12% capital gain (16% total return) in any given year than an 8% yield and zero to show on the front of capital gains (that&#8217;d result in just an 8% total return). Additionally, diversification is key for new investors, allowing them to stay afloat when the next big industry correction hits. For someone who&#8217;s looking to put such a large six-figure amount to work, it&#8217;s easy to be a bit jittery now that valuations are high and tariff threats remain. And though it&#8217;s tempting to wait for the next big market pullback, timing your entry to the market could put you at risk of missing out on further gains. At the end of the day, it&#8217;s impossible to tell what&#8217;s up next for markets over the short term. Over the long term, though, the odds are on the side of stocks. Forming a foundation with low-cost index ETFs is a smart way to go. Personally, I&#8217;d suggest bringing on a financial advisor and setting the bedrock (or foundation) of one&#8217;s portfolio around an S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index ETF. For those looking for more of a growth jolt, a Nasdaq 100 ETF or an international and emerging markets ETF may be added to the mix. Just as you wouldn&#8217;t build a house on unstable ground, you shouldn&#8217;t start a six-figure portfolio without a rock-solid foundation. For a dividend-focused investor, however, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD) or SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:SPYD) are great foundation plays, with their more-than-4% yields and history of capital appreciation. Those looking for more of a yield boost may wish to consider adding individual names to the portfolio that may be oversold at any given instance. A name like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), which yields over 7%, looks like a nice complement to the SCHD or some S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index ETF. As always, though, do understand a company, its growth narrative, and the troubles it has and may continue to face over the foreseeable future. In any case, a market newcomer may wish to consult a financial advisor to figure out how much to put in stocks, bonds, cash, and even precious metals. Also, they can green light any ETFs or individual names you&#8217;ve already researched.

    "text": "Oak Lawn Residents Die In South Side Head-On Crash, Families Raising Money For Funeral Expenses OAK LAWN, IL — Two young adults from Oak Lawn died early Sunday morning in a head-on crash on Chicago’s South Side. Now, their devastated families are trying to pick up the pieces. Just after 3 a.m., two vehicles, both Dodge Challengers, one red and the other black, were traveling northbound and southbound in the 11200 block of South Stony Island in the Deering neighborhood. Chicago police said both cars were on the same side of the street driving toward each other when they collided head on. The 20-year-old driver of the red vehicle was pronounced dead on the scene. The 20-year-old male driver of the red car was pronounced dead on the scene. His 20-year-old male passenger was transported to University of Chicago Medical Center in fair condition. The 21-year-old driver of the black Challenger, Miguel Angel Serrano, and his 19-year-old girlfriend, Celi Bedolla, were also pronounced dead on the scene, police said. Both were identified by family members on GoFundMe, who have started campaigns for their funeral expenses. Serrano is a graduate of Richards High School, a friend told Patch. Joseph Franco has started “In Memory of Miguel: Support His Loved Ones” on GoFundMe. “He was truly loved by everyone around him and would put a smile on people faces, even if you didn’t know him …,” Franco said. “His life was taken in a split second, leaving all friends and family devastated. We are all in need of support for his funeral, no donation is too small. We thank everyone for everything, and may God rest your soul, Miguel Angel Serrano.” Serrano’s visitation will take place from 3 to 8 p.m. Friday, June 27 at Wolniak Funeral Home, 5700 S. Pulaski Road, Chicago. A Mass of the Resurrection is planned for 10 a.m. Saturday, June 28, at St. Nicholas Tolentine Church, 3721 W. 62nd Ave., Chicago. Bedolla graduated from Oak Lawn Community High School. Her sister, Arianna Bedolla has organized Funeral expenses for Celi Bedolla on GoFundMe. “Long live Celi, Miguel, and anybody else that was hurt mentally or physically during a tragic time like this,” her sister said. Funeral information for Bedolla was not immediately available. Collection boxes to support the Bedolla family have also been set out, along with a memorial wall where people can leave messages and post photos of Celi, at the following Dunkin’ locations: • 7847 W 95th St, Hickory Hills• 419 S Joliet Road, Bolingbrook• 649 N Independence Blvd, Romeoville “We are heartbroken by the passing of Araceli Bedolla,” said a friend on Facebook. “Celi was a vibrant soul whose energy lit up every room she entered. Fearless and unapologetically, she brought energy, spontaneity, and unfiltered honesty to every moment. Her love for adrenaline, her bold spirit, and her ability to make others feel truly alive will be deeply missed.”",

A report from Retirement Living looked at the best places to retire in the Golden State. Oceanside ranked second on the list. The city has a strong senior community as residents aged 65 and older make up 20% of Oceanside's population, one of the highest rates in the state, according to the study. \"More seniors mean better access to age-friendly services, social programs, and health care tailored to older adults,\" Retirement Living spokesperson Jailyn Montero told Patch. The city's 8.25% sales tax is among the state's lowest, and only 8% of seniors live in poverty compared to 11.3% statewide. \"That said, coastal California isn't budget retirement territory,\" Montero added. \"Oceanside's median home price sits around $851,000 — close to the state median of $860,000 — and median rent is about $2,300 monthly. But for those who can afford it, you're getting beach access and year-round mild weather.\" To identify the top cities for retirement in California, the study's authors reviewed places with populations over 100,000 and focused on factors that matter most to retirees: percentage of population 65 and older, median home sale price, median monthly rent, poverty rate, and sales tax. Each metric was weighted according to its influence on retirement decision-making. Roseville, a city sitting just outside Sacramento, topped the rankings. About one in five residents in Roseville is 65 or older. The median home price is $635,000, according to the report, which is relatively reasonable for California. The city also has a poverty rate of 5.6% that's low compared to the state average of 11.3%. These are the top 20 cities to retire in California, according to the report: View the full report here.",

    "text": "LONGi Launches Strategic Solar Panel Manufacturing Project in Indonesia JAKARTA, Indonesia, June 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- LONGi, a global leader in solar photovoltaic (PV) solutions, has officially launched a strategic project to establish a state-of-the-art solar panel manufacturing facility in Indonesia, in collaboration with Pertamina New & Renewable Energy (Pertamina NRE), a subsidiary of Indonesia's state-owned energy company Pertamina. This partnership underscores a shared commitment to advancing renewable energy adoption in Southeast Asia and supporting Indonesia's ambitious energy transition goals. The new facility, located in Deltamas, West Java, will feature an annual production capacity of 1.6 GW, utilizing LONGi's cutting-edge Hybrid Passivated Back Contact (HPBC) 2.0 technology to deliver high-efficiency solar modules. The project is set to commence manufacturing preparation by June 2025, significantly boosting Indonesia's domestic solar PV production capabilities. This collaboration between LONGi and Pertamina NRE is a strategic step toward strengthening Indonesia's renewable energy supply chain. By combining LONGi's global leadership in solar technology with Pertamina NRE's deep understanding of the local energy market, the project will enhance the Domestic Component Level (TKDN), aligning with the Indonesian government's push for greater local content in renewable energy projects. Additionally, the facility will help meet the rapidly growing demand for high-quality solar PV modules in both the domestic market and across Southeast Asia. In the RUPTL 2025-2034, Indonesia has set a target of 17.1GW of new PV installations over the next ten years, which indicates that the demand for PV in Indonesia will continue to be unleashed with the advancement of the plan. The commencement of the RUPTL project comes at the right time. It will further improve the local PV industry chain while meeting the regional market demand and play an active role in upgrading the level of localized manufacturing in Indonesia (TKDN), thus helping Indonesia to make steady progress in the development of the PV industry. Mr. Dennis She, Vice President of LONGi Group, in his welcome speech at the launch event, emphasized the company's vision for sustainable energy development: \"Indonesia holds immense potential in renewable energy, and LONGi is proud to contribute our world-leading solar technology to this transformative journey. This facility represents not just an investment in manufacturing but a long-term partnership to accelerate Indonesia's clean energy future. By localizing production, we aim to drive down costs, foster innovation, and create high-value green jobs, reinforcing our commitment to a net-zero world.\" As the global leading company, LONGi brings unparalleled expertise and innovation to Indonesia's renewable energy sector, further solidifying Indonesia's position as a key player in sustainable energy. This milestone reflects LONGi's dedication to empowering global energy transition through technological excellence and strategic collaborations, paving the way for a greener future.",

Tim Settle Jr., a defensive tackle for the Houston Texans, and Greg Stroman Jr., a free agent who last played for the New York Giants, held their third annual football camp for about 200 youth and families at their alma mater, Unity Reed High School, on June 14. The camp for children ages 8 to 15 focused on developing football skills with help from Settle, Stroman and local coaches. Despite a flood watch and cloudy conditions on camp day, children were \"excited and engaged from start to finish,\" according to Madi Wingert, manager of PR at Upper Edge Sports, which represents the NFL stars. \"Rookie and returning campers, along with sponsors and families, all shared how much they enjoyed the day and expressed their excitement for next year’s camp, including who they plan to bring with them,\" said Wingert. \"Across all three years, campers, sponsors, and families alike have noted how interactive, genuine, and hands-on Tim and Greg are with everyone at the event, which remains one of the most appreciated and unique parts of the experience.\" The football camp focused on the fundamentals for campers to improve their game. After drills, campers put their skills to the test with a series of games. Families and sponsors had the chance to watch the game and interact with Settle, Stroman and other special guests. High school football players could also volunteer for the camp, in turn getting a chance to speak with Settle and Stroman about their own athletic goals. \"It's about paying it forward, uplifting the next generation, and building something lasting in the place that built them,\" said Wingert. Settle and Stroman took over the NFLPA’s Instagram account during the day, sharing their interactions with campers. Stroman's mother, who owns a baking business, brought back her signature cupcakes to the event to the delight of campers. Children left the camp not only with training but also a camp T-shirt, souvenirs and autographs from Settle and Stroman. Giving back to the Manassas youth is personal for Settle and Stroman.

    "text": "Caregiving in America: NPHI Serves as National Partner on PBS Documentary Premiering Tonight WASHINGTON, June 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The National Partnership for Healthcare and Hospice Innovation (NPHI) is proud to serve as a national partner on the new documentary Caregiving, executive produced by Academy Award-nominated actor and filmmaker Bradley Cooper. The film, which premieres tonight at 9:00 PM ET on PBS (check local listings), offers an intimate and unflinching look into the lives of caregivers across the country—people who provide physical, emotional, and often invisible care to loved ones facing serious illness or decline. The two-hour documentary, produced by Cooper's production company Lea Pictures, as well as WETA Washington, D.C., in association with Ark Media, is narrated by award-winning actress Uzo Aduba and centers on the deeply personal experiences of caregivers and the emotional, physical, and logistical challenges they face every day. As the number of people needing care increases and the caregiving workforce shrinks, the demands on family caregivers have never been greater. According to recent studies, in addition to 5 million paid caregivers nationally, it is estimated that between 53 million to 105.6 million U.S. adults provide unpaid caregiving for ill, aging, or disabled family members and friends. In addition, an estimated 5.4 million children and adolescents in the U.S. are direct caregivers. Caregiving explores these pressures while also highlighting innovative approaches to caregiving in the 21st century. As part of NPHI's commitment to supporting caregivers—especially those providing care to their loved ones facing advanced illness—NPHI has supported a series of three flagship preview screenings held in advance of the national premiere. Events took place at the George Washington University in Washington, D.C., the United Nations Headquarters in New York City, and most recently in Los Angeles at Wallis Annenberg GenSpace. The New York event, hosted at the United Nations, brought together a diverse group of global changemakers, caregiving advocates, and caregivers themselves. NPHI leadership—including Board Chair Diana Franchitto, CEO Tom Koutsoumpas, and President Carole Fisher—attended and had the opportunity to personally thank Bradley Cooper for his role in creating a film that is both personal and transformational. Cooper's remarks focused on his own caregiving experience supporting his late father through serious illness and hospice care—a journey that deeply shaped his perspective and inspired the documentary. \"The caregiving experience I had with my father inspired this documentary. During his battle with lung cancer, I came face to face with the overwhelming realities of taking care of a loved one,\" said Bradley Cooper, actor, producer, director, and caregiver. \"I was lucky enough that I was able to be there for my Dad. And I certainly benefited from the help we also got from others. Caregivers are heroic people. Their ability to focus and give all of themselves is something I stand in awe of. I came to appreciate how we need to care for caregivers better. It is my hope that Caregiving will provide affirmation and support for those who do this profoundly meaningful and increasingly vital work.\" \"Being at the United Nations—among leaders and advocates who share a vision for improving care in this country and beyond—was profoundly inspiring,\" said Tom Koutsoumpas, CEO of NPHI. \"This documentary brings into focus the extraordinary and often unseen labor of love caregivers provide. At NPHI, we know that caregivers are vital not only to hospice and advanced illness care, but to the entire system of support for people as their health declines.\" \"It was especially meaningful to hear caregivers speak directly about their journeys at the UN event,\" said Carole Fisher, President of NPHI. \"Their vulnerability and strength reminded us all that caregiving is deeply human work—and it's happening quietly in homes all across the country. These are the stories that must be seen, heard, and valued.\" \"Virtually every person will be a caregiver at some point in their life,\" said Diana Franchitto, President and CEO of HopeHealth and Board Chair of NPHI. \"Speaking on behalf of our nonprofit membership and the people we collectively serve, I can attest to the immense value caregivers bring—not just at the end of life, but throughout the entire healthcare system. Their impact is immeasurable.\" The New York screening welcomed a notable list of caregivers and advocates, including Emma Heming Willis, who has spoken publicly about supporting her husband, actor Bruce Willis, following his diagnosis with frontotemporal dementia. The evening highlighted both the deeply personal and systemic importance of caregiving as a national public health issue. A panel discussion followed the screening, featuring Bradley Cooper, who shared reflections on his father's final months; the film's director, Chris Durrance; Matthew Cauli, a spousal caregiver featured in the film; and Ai-jen Poo, executive director of Caring Across Generations, who is also featured in the film. The panel was moderated by Deborah Roberts, ABC News correspondent and caregiver to her mother living with dementia. Together, the group underscored the importance of visibility, support, and long-term policy change for America's caregivers. While Caregiving spans a wide range of caregiving experiences—from adult children to spouses to grandchildren—it also includes emotionally resonant stories of people caring for loved ones at the end of life. These moments, while often complex, can also be some of the most meaningful and life-affirming. NPHI's mission is rooted in honoring those experiences and the individuals who provide that care. Caregiving airs tonight, Tuesday, June 24 at 9:00 PM ET on PBS (check local listings), and is available for streaming now on PBS.org, the PBS app, and on wellbeings.org. The film is part of WellBeings, a multi-year, multiplatform health campaign from public media, and aims to elevate the visibility, dignity, and impact of caregivers across the country.
